Course Project Requirement
1. Requirement and data gathering
2. Data annotation/tests writing
3. Implementation/integrations/model training
4. Testing and Error Analysis

Each of these steps MUST be implemented in some manner.
Keep the story in mind, focusing on the overall goal. Take note of several problems faced in the implementation and how they were solved. Regression tests.

Overall Goal
Coming from the perspective of a previous air traffic controller with six years of experience, one of the difficulties imposed on the ATC workforce after aviation incidents is the transcription of recorded audio. “Running the tapes” is what the industry refers to this as, and it involves an experienced air traffic controller being pulled from their other duties to painstakingly transcribe and analyze audio to create a paper record for an incident; this process is labor-intensive, slow, and error-prone, overall a detriment to the career field. My goal is to create an automated NLP system designed specifically to transcribe tape runes accurately, potentially including the labels of involved entities (aircraft identifiers, different air traffic control positions, etc.), and produce a transcript and summary of the incident. Speaking from experience, this solution would greatly streamline post-incident review processes, leaving a controller free to work outside of a quick review of the accuracy of the transcription.

Scope
- Train an open source NLP model to the unique speech patterns and specialized terminology used in air traffic control.
- Implement labeling of entities in the communication using verbal identification queues inherent to air traffic control communications.
- Produce a functioning prototype of the application capable of processing audio samples from publicly available archives of air traffic control communications.

The data for this project is a folder of 325 mp3 files obtained from liveatc.net of recordings from air traffic control communications.

Create a detailed guide on how to implement this project from the ground up. You can cut functionality mentioned in the overall goal if it is not feasible. I have 1 day to complete this project, starting from zero. As long as it demonstrates understanding of NLP concepts, it will suffice. Focus on demonstrating unique approaches, using novel techniques or creative data agumentations. You MUST highlight complexity in the data gathering, error analysis, architecture, and optimization realms.
